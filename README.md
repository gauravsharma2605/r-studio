# ✈️ Flight Delays Analysis – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing **flight delays** using **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** techniques in **R**.  
The main objective was to identify patterns, trends, and possible factors that contribute to flight delays, such as weather conditions, scheduled departure times, and flight distances.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Perform exploratory data analysis on flight delays dataset  
- Visualize delays using **histograms, scatter plots, box plots, and pie charts**  
- Analyze the impact of weather, time of departure, and other variables on flight delays  
- Summarize insights into data-driven conclusions  

## 📂 Dataset
- `schedtime` – Scheduled time  
- `carrier` – Airline code  
- `deptime` – Actual departure time  
- `dest` – Destination airport  
- `distance` – Flight distance (miles)  
- `weather` – 0 = on time, 1 = delayed due to weather  
- `delay` – Delay status (ontime / delayed)  
- Other time-based features: date, day of month, day of week  

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- **R Programming**  
- `ggplot2` for visualization  
- `dplyr` for data manipulation  
- `readxl` for dataset import  

## 📊 Key Visualizations
- **Histograms** of scheduled time, departure time, distance, and day of month  
- **Scatter plots** for delayed vs on-time flights  
- **Box plots** for delays across days of month  
- **Pie chart** showing % of on-time vs delayed flights  

### Flight Delays Summary
- **On-time flights:** ~85%  
- **Delayed flights:** ~15%  
- Weather is a major factor in delays  
- Peak delays occur at certain departure hours




## 📈 Insights
- Majority of flights were **on-time** (approx 80%)  
- **Weather** plays a significant role in delays  
- Peak delays occur at certain **departure hours**  
- Longer distances don’t always correlate with higher delays  

## 📌 Outcome
This project strengthened my skills in:  
- Data cleaning & transformation  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Data visualization in R
